The [Google Drive Text Editor] (https://texteditor.cloud57.de) opens text files stored in Google Drive in a text editor directly in the browser.

The text file does not have to be downloaded first, but can be viewed and edited directly in the browser. Changes to the document can be saved directly back to Google Drive as a new document version.  

The Google Drive Text Editor uses [ACE] (https://ace.c9.io/), an embeddable high performance code editor written in javascript.
