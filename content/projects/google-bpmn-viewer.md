The [Google Drive BPMN Viewer] (https://bpmnviewer.cloud57.de) displays BPMN diagrams stored in Google Drive in a viewer.

The viewer uses the Camunda BPMN Viewer from the project [bpmn.io] (https://bpmn.io) and integrates it into a single page application (SPA).

Users can view BPMN graphs directly from the Google Drive web application, without having to download the diagram first and then viewing it in a suitable application.
